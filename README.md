# Colony Survival
Public gamedata files for Colony Survival

Mostly used as a repository to send pull requests for translation updates.
Check the highest versioned branch for the most recent version.
Check gamedata/localization/localecoverage.md for data on how complete the various translations are.
Files will have keys starting with "\_MISSING\_" followed by the english version for missing/untranslated text.
Localecoverage will be updated after pull request merges.

To add a new locale:
1) Preferably use a text editor like notepad++, as for example notepad.exe does not properly support UTF-8 encoding.
2) Make a new folder under gamedata/localization/ and copy-paste the .json files over from the en-US locale.
3) Replace all the strings on the right side with the language you're translating it to.
