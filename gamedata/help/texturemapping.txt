format for texturemapping.json files:

All paths can be relative to the location of the json file (if the path starts with a '.', like "./albedo") or relative to the game installation folder ("gamedata/textures/blocks/albedo/")
Types.json files will point to an entry (collection of the albedo, emissive, height and normal keys) in a texturemapping file using the "sideall", "sidey+" etc keys.
The entries in the texturemapping file will point to a combination of texture files to use

"_settings" is a special case node to indicate some settings. Options:
	"defaultAlbedo"
	"defaultEmissive"
	"defaultHeight"
	"defaultNormal"
	- The path to the default texture file to use if a value ("albedo", "emissive", "height", "normal") is not set.
	"fileExtension"
	- The default file extension to use on values. Format it like ".png", only other supported is (probably, untested as of writing) ".jpg" and ".jpeg"
	"folderAlbedo"
	"folderEmissive"
	"folderHeight"
	"folderNormal"
	- The folder path to use in which the values can be found.
"some_node":
	"albedo"
	"emissive"
	"height"
	"normal"
	- Each of these is optional. If not set, it will default to the value of defaultAlbedo etc in the _settings node.
	- if the value does not end in .jpeg, .png or .jpg it will resolve using the folder and file extension specified by the _settings node.
	- Example:
		"albedo" : "some_file"
		"folderAlbedo" : "./path/to/file/"
		"fileExtension" : ".png"
		this will result in the file being: "./path/to/file/some_file.png"
	- If the value does end with .jpeg, .png or .jpg it'll use that as path:
	- Example:
		"albedo" : "gamedata/textures/materials/blocks/albedo/neutral.png"
		this will use the neutral albedo texture that comes with the game
	- Example:
		"albedo" : "./albedo/some_file.png"
		this will use the file some_file.png from the albedo folder *found inside the same folder where the texture mapping file is*
