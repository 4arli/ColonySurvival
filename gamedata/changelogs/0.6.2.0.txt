0.6.2.0 (2018-xx-xx)

-Changed monster spawner:
| Previous behaviour would only spawn zombies when old ones died when the zombie cap/colony was hit. This benefitted long mazes disproportionally.
| Now zombies spawn constantly - irrelevant of the amount alive already.
-Fixed a very rare edge case where a chunk could be unloaded on the server if somebody disconnects (while it should stay loaded)

Modding changes:
-Added auto-generating documentation. Uses ModCallback and ModDocumentation attributes. Press F1 in the server UI to generate it (will also generate for mods)
-Reworked monster spawner code;
| Removed monsterSpawner.GetMaxZombieCount(colonistCount) - no logical replacement, as there's no max zombie count anymore.
| Remove ZombiesPerNPC, ZombiesPerNPCSecondary, ZombiesPerNPCSecondaryAtCount from settings/server.json; Replaced by RespawnCooldownPerZombiePerColonist
