0.6.1.2 (2018-05-08)

-Fixed server browser scrolling not resetting when changing filters (possibly preventing you from scrolling back to values)
-Fixed history tab of the server browser not working
-Fixed player loading errors if some science they completed is removed from code
-Applied the fix to show empty item stacks of types previously seen to the item selection menu for construction areas
-Added a key to hold to make multiple construction areas in a row - defaults to Left Alt, see PlaceMultipleAreas in the key mapping menu.

-From github:
-Locale updates for ja-JP
-Locale updates for nl-NL
-Locale updates for fr-FR

modding changes:
-Improved handling of relative paths to properly support ../ and other complex paths
-Texturemapping files loaded through modinfo.json files now support specifying full paths in the nodes themselves
-Added a warning for when a type has sideall etc registered but those do are not registered as texturemappings
-Added a warning in the recipe json constructor for when requirements/results have <= 0 items or an invalid type
-Added an auto-formatting step to most places where you can insert paths to make the paths a consistent format (all .\gamedata\etc\etc.type), preventing duplicate issues in the filetable
| Hopefully you won't notice a thing from this
-Added a warning when you're registering 2 files that have equivalent paths except for capitalization
