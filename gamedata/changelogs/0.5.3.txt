0.5.3 (2017-01-26)

-Increased stack size of stairs to 60 so it is multiple of the crafting recipe

-Updated fr-FR, ja-JP and es-ES locale through github (to 100% of what is localizable)
-Updated pt-BR locale from email to 100% (by nafodebit, https://steamcommunity.com/id/nadiongaming/)
-Updated ko-KR locale from email (by 왕군게임국 , https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCqONn4EbAYzIVEGAoQxmZUA). Had some collisions with github updated locales.

-Fixed an issue where the servername would get overwritten in gamedata/savegames/server.json
-Fixed an issue preventing lights from updating their shadows in some situations
-Removed QuarterBlockRoot from builtinblocks (didn't exist in the final build of 0.5.2)
-Optimized a method related to finding the closest crate (that really was a slow one)
-Slightly optimized some network traffic (don't send indicator updates if people are out of npc rendering range anyway)

Modding changes:
-Added Server.Monsters.MonsterTracker.MonstersTotal
-Revamped the npc indicator system.
| Check Server.Indicator.Send* for ways to send indicators to positions and npc's
| Typical change would be a job where one calls:
| - state.SetIndicator(NPCIndicatorType.Crafted, 8.5f, BuiltinBlocks.Berry);
| which is now replaced with:
| - state.SetIndicator(new Shared.IndicatorState(8.5f, BuiltinBlocks.Berry));
| Most of the 'special' NPCIndicatorTypes are removed, in favor of manually selecting whether the progress bar is red or green and whether the diagonal red line shows up.
-Added BlockJobBase.UsedNPC property
-Added CraftingJobBase.BlockInventory property
-Added ScientistJob.CraftingCooldown property
-Made GuardJobBase.SetupSettings() and GuardJobBase.OnShoot() public
