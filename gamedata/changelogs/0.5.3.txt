0.5.3 (2017-01-**)

-Updated fr-FR, ja-JP and es-ES locale (to 100% of what is localizable)
-Increased stack size of stairs to 50 so it is multiple of the crafting recipe

-Fixed an issue preventing lights from updating their shadows in some situations
-Removed QuarterBlockRoot from builtinblocks (didn't exist in the final build of 0.5.2)
-Optimized a method related to finding the closest crate (that really was a slow one)
-Slightly optimized some network traffic (don't send indicator updates if people are out of npc rendering range anyway)

Modding changes:
-Added Server.Monsters.MonsterTracker.MonstersTotal
