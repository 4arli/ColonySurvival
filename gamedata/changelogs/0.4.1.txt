0.4.1 (2017-11-*)

Improve usability of the crafting limits interface: Limit shown is now the actual limit of items made, not recipes made. Also shows missing ingredients in red, and the amount currently in the stockpile.
Possibly fix an issue where colonists would randomly fail to find a path once (but succeed on repeated attempts)
Increase path complexity limit because increased pathfinding performance allows it

API/mod related stuff:
- Refactored NPC.JobTracker a bit to make it more accessible
