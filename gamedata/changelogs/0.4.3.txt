0.4.3 (2017-11-22)

Welcome to Update 0.4.3!

We noticed that the added complexity of 0.4.0 made the game difficult to understand for new players. To streamline the early stages of building a colony, non-vital content has been locked behind research. We hope this will make the game less overwhelming for new players. We understand that it might be annoying for more experienced players and people who've already started colonies. The research costs are low to make sure they can unlock the content they were used to quickly. We've also worked to make the research menu more aesthetically pleasing.

Changelog summary:

-New colonies don't start with wheat seeds and flax seeds anymore, but gain them by unlocking the related research
-New colonies start with extra straw to compensate for wheat being locked behind research
-Swords actually deal extra damage now
-We added a shortcut to the science interface in the Banner Menu.
-We've motivated the tailor to work quicker
-Wheat farmers, flax farmers, archers, crossbow guards, matchlock gunners, ovens, grindstones, kilns, splitting stumps, mints & shops are now locked behind (mostly quick & easy) research
-Categories in the science interface are now labeled clearly; available, unavailable & unlocked.
-Unavailable research is now black & white, to make it appear less overwhelming and important
-Added a text to to the science interface that explains how to recruit scientists
-Updated some tooltips to better reflect the changes in 0.4.0
