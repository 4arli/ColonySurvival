0.6.1 (2018-04-xx)

-Fixed an issue where if the server crashed you could have people trying to go to invisible jobs; they self-destruct now

-Overhauled the server browser menu
| Fixed the "view players" option per server not working
| Show whether or not a server is modded, and which mods are running

Modding changes:
-Log a warning when a mesh file contains more than 65000 vertices
-Added a modinfo.txt help file to the gamedata/help/ folder
-Marked RotatedCraftingJobBase as Obsolete; it'll work as it did, but it's not used by any game things anymore. Instead use the IsValidWorldType virtual method described below
-Added BlockJobBase.worldType, BlockJobBase.worldTypeChecked fields.
-Added BlockJobBase.CheckWorldType() & BlockJobBase.IsValidWorldType(type)
--The idea is that at 'critical' points the world type will be sampled once, and passed into IsValidWorldType(type). If that returns false, the job self-destructs.
