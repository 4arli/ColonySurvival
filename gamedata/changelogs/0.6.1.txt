0.6.1 (2018-04-xx)

-Overhauled the server browser menu
| Added password support
| Show total colonist count on a server
| Allow sorting by ping, player count, version and server name
| Allow filtering for empty / full / compatible
| Fixed the "view players" option per server not working
| Show whether or not a server is modded, and which mods are running

-Stockpile now keeps tiles when they reach 0, to prevent the tiles from moving about a lot
-Fixed an issue where if the server crashed you could have people trying to go to invisible jobs; they self-destruct now
-Improved the use of timestamping to track things; should speed up various parts of the game (server and client)
-Fixed the forester sometimes not setting a cooldown in its job

Modding changes:
-Log a warning when a mesh file contains more than 65000 vertices
-Added a modinfo.txt help file to the gamedata/help/ folder
-Marked RotatedCraftingJobBase as Obsolete; it'll work as it did, but it's not used by any game things anymore. Instead use the IsValidWorldType virtual method described below
-Added BlockJobBase.worldType, BlockJobBase.worldTypeChecked fields.
-Added BlockJobBase.CheckWorldType() & BlockJobBase.IsValidWorldType(type)
--The idea is that at 'critical' points the world type will be sampled once, and passed into IsValidWorldType(type). If that returns false, the job self-destructs.
-Added Time.SecondsSinceStartDoubleThisFrame
-Added Time.MillisecondsSinceStartThisFrame
-- same as the non-ThisFrame one, but is set once every frame (in an UpdateStart callback) to prevent excessive timestamping calls
