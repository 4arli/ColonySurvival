0.6.0.3 (2018-04-02)

-Chunks updates very close to you now have priority over updates far away (including world loading updates)
-Fixed science not being received correctly sometimes
-Fixed the builder sometimes mis-placing a block when completing the job
-Slightly improved chunk transfer window growing/shrinking again - should not grow as much when the server is not responding (due to slow autosaves as an example)
