0.6.3.0 (2018-06-21)

Welcome to update 0.6.3!

This update adds a search bar to the stockpile, a better tooltip for most items, a new loading screen and arrow trails. The trails can be turned off with the "particle effects" setting.

Have fun!

-Reworked the loading/connecting screen
| Added support for localizing the texts
| The multiplayer password field is now automatically selected for typing when it pops up
| Added a nice background
| Added hints
-Added a search field to the stockpile to filter by type/name/category
-Added a "made in" part in the tooltip, where it shows at what job an item can be made by npc's.
-Updated es-ES, fr-FR, ja-JP locales to 0.6.2.x (credits to their respective translators on github)
-Updated ch-CN locale (from ~70% to 96% up to date, apoligies for late update, it got forgotten)
-"Stack-hiring" colonists using control now snaps to open jobs / beds left
-Changed the stats menu's in the corner of the ingame screen
-Added particle trails to guards shooting things
-Added particle trails to projectiles you shoot yourself
-Area/job highlights now appear when you hold a bed as well (besides the crate and command tool)

-Fixed a bug where chunks entirely of one type get corrupted if the types' item index is more than 127 (triggered by mods mostly)
-Fixed a plausible crash related to steam if the loading screen stopped before a server ping was returned
-Fixed video settings menu starting scrolled all the way down
-Fixed Crossbow bolt science requiring bloomery science explicitly - it's already included in the military science bag dependency (thanks JackPS9)
-Fixed tooltip clipping out of the game window on lower resolutions
-Fixed a bug causing the inventory to lower FPS by quite a lot
-Fixed a performance bug where receiving inventory updates led to a frametime spike
-Fixed an issue where monsters would only spawn at 1 banner if you have multiple of them (mods/cheats)
-Tiny RAM use reduction on the server/client -> do not store placeholder localization keys

Modding changes:
-Expanded networkUI options:
| Added DropDownNoLabel, Label, Toggle, ToggleNoLabel, EmptySpace, Line, HorizontalSplit, HorizontalGrid, ItemIcon, ButtonCallback types
-Added OnPlayerPushedNetworkUIButton callback to deal with ButtonCallback
-Added ItemTypes.ItemType.GetRootParentType()
-Added server-defined popups for the client using NetworkUI menu's:
| Send a menu using NetworkMenuManager.SendServerPopup, receive the changes using the OnPlayerChangedNetworkUIStorage callback with identifier "server_popup"
| Added networkmenu.Height / Width properties, only used with this popup
| Set the popup header text by setting a (localizable) string in the LocalStorage with key "header"

| Added ItemTypes.ItemType.ToJSONDEBUG() for this purpose
-Added JSONNode.Create(IList<T>) overloads to serialize lists in a simple way (makes an array node) for JSON-supported types
-Added JSONNode.Create(IList<T>, Func<T, JSONNode>) overload to serialize lists of non-standard json types
-Added OnSendAreaHighlights and OnRemoveAreaHighlight callbacks, to send custom area highlights (the 3d frame around an area)
