0.4.2 (2017-11-**)

Changed rendering of close torches a bit, hopefully fixing crash issues with lower end integrated graphics
Changed zombie updating script:
- Should not teleport anymore when the server lags.
- Significantly better performance for zombies that are "just walking"
- Significantly better performance for zombies that are looking for other targets to consider
- Overall, servers should support 2-8x as much zombies as on 0.4.1, depending on how complex mazes are.

-Significant update to zh-CN localization
