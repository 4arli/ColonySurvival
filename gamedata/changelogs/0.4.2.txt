0.4.2 (2017-11-17)

Changed zombie updating script:
- Don't teleport anymore when the server lags. (they pause instead)
- Significantly better performance for zombies that are "just walking"
- Significantly better performance for zombies that are looking for other targets to consider
- Overall, servers should support 2-8x as much zombies as on 0.4.1, depending on how complex mazes are.
Changed player collision scripts substantially, fixing ground phasing issues (not the ones where you place blocks on a player though)
Changed savegame region saving to be more resistant to crashing. This does <not> solve the problem of jobs being broken after a server crash, but does fix regions resetting
The items required for a npc to take a job are now refunded upon them leaving that job
Temporarily limit the "delete" button in the load world menu. It has to be clicked 3 times in a row to work, this should be improved in the future (a full confirmation box)

Fixed a variety of crash issues (related to the new torch rendering from 0.4)
Fixed an issue causing the wrapper to crash
Fixed an issue leaving the colonyserver process open if the dedicated wrapper crashes
Fixed the requirements text of crafting limits to work with > 4 requirements
Shorten stockpile counts of > 100 000 to > 100K

Added korean localization
Significant update to simplified chinese localization
Update to german localization
Small update to spanish localization
Fixed crossbowbolt tooltip missing (typo in locale)

Modding changes: For the new situation see the callback documentation at gamedata/help/modding_callbacks.txt
OnNPCJobChanged callback now has an argument of type TupleStruct<NPC.NPCBase, NPC.IJob, NPC.IJob> instead of only NPC.NPCBase. The 1st job (tuple.item2) is the old job, the 2nd is the new job.
