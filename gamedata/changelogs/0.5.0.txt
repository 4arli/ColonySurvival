0.5.0 (2017-12-**)

-Added stonemason job (TODO: icon, tooltip, textures, science)
| Makes dark red, black, dark yellow and red colored bricks from standard bricks
-Added lanterns, light emitting blocks (TODO: icons, textures, science?)
| Made with the bronze anvil, requiring higher end ingredients
-Added a new type of planks (TODO: icons, 'normal' color planks with the new textures?)
-Added crystal, result of smelting silver rich galena (TODO: icon, tooltip)
-Added dyer job (TODO: icon, tooltip, textures, science)
| Colors planks and lanterns:
| Blue, cyan, green, grey, pink, red and yellow planks
| Blue, cyan, green, orange, pink, red and white lanterns
| Black, dark red, dark yellow and red bricks (TODO: icons)

-Added support for colored variants of blocks (with a mask texture to determine what part to color)
-Added support for importing .ply files with vertex colors
-Added an example texture pack mod (/gamedata/mods/Examples/TexturePack/)
-Substantially simplified modding existing game files

-Fixed a few blocks having incorrect normal mapping
-Changed emissive / mask textures to be in linear space instead of gamma space
-Changed height / smoothness / specularity textures to be in linear space instead of gamma space
-Limit time spend spawning zombies per server tick; 50 ms cap per tick default (server.json setting, Zombies -> MSPerTick)
-Tweaked lighting brightness a bit if eye adaptation is disabled
-Tweaked TAA settings to remove some artifacts (could see movement through blocks). Should look less blurry overall as well.
-Changed internal mesh structure, ever so slightly faster rendering + (V)RAM savings:
| Removed 4 bytes / vertex (precalculate the offset fixing gaps)
| Removed 4 bytes / vertex (compress uv components into 1 float)
| Removed 8 bytes / vertex (compress the 4 texture indices to 2 floats)
| Added 4 bytes / vertex (mesh color)
| Saves about 45 MB RAM, ~18 MB VRAM in a benchmark
-Ported various blocks with solid colors to the new color system
-Sorted the types by alphabet in types.json & texturemapping.json
-Collapsed some nodes of types.json to lower size/line count
-Fixed snow, sand and cherry blossom not sorting in the stockpile

Modding changes:
-Changed the torches customData fields from "red", "green", "blue" integers to a "color" : "#ffffff" field
-Fixed normal maps requiring you to flip the red channel to work properly
-Added ability to (through code):
| Change the npc textures; NPCTypeNormalSettings has some static fields for it
| Change the water textures; ItemTypesServer.Texture_Water_* are static fields for it
-Changed modinfo.json format:
| Removed the root object node with the "assemblies" key. Root node is now the inner array used previously
| Changed compatibleversions array to use "x.x.x" as version instead of major/minor/build objects
| Added a mod version field to each mod description
| Renamed "path" key to "dllpath"
-Added the following keys to every mod description in modinfo.json's. Each loads replacement files from the set directory if they exist.
| "overrideAlbedoFolder"
| "overrideEmissiveFolder"
| "overrideHeightFolder"
| "overrideNormalFolder"
| "overrideMeshesFolder"
| "overrideIconFolder"
| "overrideNPCFolder"
| "overrideWaterFolder"
| "overrideAudioFolder"
-Changed ModLoader.ModAssembly class into ModLoader.ModDescription.
| Assemblies are optional
| Access to the description JSON
-Added ModLoader.AddFolderRedirection() and ModLoader.RedirectFile().
| Used to implement the overrideFolder keys above. Call RedirectFile with a path to a file and it may return the 'replaced' path.
